# hyperapp-examples [TODO LIST]
## Examples from React To Be Ported To Hyperapp
The purpose of this is to have links to examples that shows Hyperapp's core concepts, organizing large projects, dealing with 3rd party libraries and so on.

### All the examples should try to have: 
1. Have a testable UI (i.e. not just concepts)
2. Have Comments/documentation
3. Closer and similar to "Elm" architecture than "React" architecture.
   1. Use Functional programming tehniques
   2. Use Functional libraries like Ramda (if needed)
   3. Use Flow (if possible) for type checking.
   4. Use "MayBe" or Null checks to avoid all run-time errors.
